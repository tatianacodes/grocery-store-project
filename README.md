# Grocery Store Project (C)

This is a beginner C project from Codecademy where I practiced declaring variables using different data types like `int`, `double`, and `char`.

## 💻 Features

- Declares and stores values for apple inventory
- Uses type casting to convert a `double` review score to an `int`
- (Optional) Uses `printf()` to display values in a formatted sentence

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Variable declaration
- Type casting in C
- Format specifiers (e.g. `%.2f`, `%d`, `%c`)
- Code organization

## 🖥 Sample Output
An apple costs: $1.49, there are 23 in inventory found in section: F and your customers gave it an average review of 82%!

## 📝 Note

This is part of my learning journey through Codecademy’s C course.
